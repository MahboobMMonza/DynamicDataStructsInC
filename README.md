# Dynamic Data Structure Experimentations/Implementations in C
This is a repo I am using to learn about efficient dynamic data structure implementations in C, as well as learning some
ways to incorporate OOP-like behaviour in C. Looking to also learn how to properly organize library source code as well
as makefile practices (or maybe just succumb to CMake). Planning to incorporate some of these structures into other
repos I am using to learn in C, such as
[this one I am using to lean networking in C](https://github.com/MahboobMMonza/C_Networking). Feel free to send me
feedback (you probably have even been sent here by me to do just that :sweat_smile:).
